# My Agent

HillanHelper is a contribution workflow that combines GitHub Copilot’s AI coding suggestions with manual issue resolution. It helps contributors:

- Understand and triage issues
- Draft fixes using Copilot suggestions
- Improve documentation and accessibility
- Automate CI setup and testing
- Submit clean, teachable PRs

This agent is not a bot—it’s a mindset and a workflow that empowers contributors to build legacy-ready codebases with dignity and clarity..
